# Introduction

Learning c from scratch isn't really that hard. Its the lazyness that made it hard for me.
I have been read all the chapters for 3 days straight. But atleast now I have read all those chapters and
I hope all of that knowledge that I gain will stayed with me until I get a job.
This is my take on learning C with Beej's guide book and its fun.
